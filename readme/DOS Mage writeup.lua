	Idea:	DOS Mage - Dungeons would be a floor based dungeon crawler where the player has access to an emulated command line.
			The player has to navigate various directories (e.g. floors, self, chests) to get to the bottom of the dungeon.
			As you go you can collect items dropped by enemies and manage your inventory and stats.
			You can play as a variety of heros (I have art for mage, rogue, warrior, claric, warlock, ranger, and orc).
			Characters are unlocked at floor milestone (e.g. floor 5, 10, 20, etc).
			Your characters level up and you can mount skill points to different stats.

	Using:	Love2d Engine and frameworks that go along with it.

	Group:	Joel Williams, Jaino Vennet, Esteban Kott, Melec Rodriguez, Tom Plumber

	Storyline:	An evil warlock has triumphed over the greatest hero in the land, computerizing his brain and locking in at the top of a dungeon.
				Fight through hordes of darkness and defeat the evil warlock to free your mind and the world!
